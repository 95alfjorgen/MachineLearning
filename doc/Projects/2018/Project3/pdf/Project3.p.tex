\subsection{Premises for project 3}

For project 3, you can propose own data sets that relate to your research interests or just use existing data sets from say
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets}}{Kaggle} 

\item The \href{{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html}}{University of California at Irvine (UCI) with its  machine learning repository}

\item The credit card data set from \href{{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients}}{UCI} is also interesting and links to a \href{{https://bradzzz.gitbooks.io/ga-seattle-dsi/content/dsi/dsi_05_classification_databases/2.1-lesson/assets/datasets/DefaultCreditCardClients_yeh_2009.pdf}}{recent scientific article}. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The approach to the analysis of these new data sets should follow to a large extent what you did in projects 1 and 2. That is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Whether you end up with a regression or a classification problem, you should employ at least two of the methods we have discussed among \textbf{linear regression (including Ridge and Lasso)}, \textbf{Logistic Regression}, \textbf{Neural Networks}, \textbf{Support Vector Machines} and \textbf{Decision Trees and Random Forests}.  If you wish to venture into \textbf{convolutional neural networks} or \textbf{recurrent neural networks}, or extensions of neural networkds, feel free to do so. 

\item For project 3, you should feel free to use your own codes from projects 1 and 2, eventually write your own for SVMs and/or Decision trees and random forests' or use the available functionality of \textbf{scikit-learn}, \textbf{tensorflow}, etc. 

\item The estimates you used and tested in projects 1 and 2 should also be included, that is the $R2$-score, \textbf{MSE}, cross-validation and/or bootstrap. 

\item If possible, you should link the data sets with exisiting research and analyses thereof. Scientific articles which have used Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the data are highly welcome. Perhaps you can improve previous analyses and even publish a new article? 

\item A critical assessment of the methods with ditto perspectives and recommendations is also something you need to include.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
All in all, the report should follow the same pattern with abstract, introduction, methods, code, results, conclusions etc as the two previous projects. 

We propose also an alternative to the above. This is a project on using machine learning methods (neural networks mainly) to the solution of ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. 

This is a field with a large interest recently, spanning from studies of turbulence in meteorology to the solution of quantum mechanical systems. 

\paragraph{Part a): Text to come.}
\subsection{Introduction to numerical projects}

Here follows a brief recipe and recommendation on how to write a report for each
project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Give a short description of the nature of the problem and the eventual  numerical methods you have used.

  \item Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.

  \item Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.

  \item If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.

  \item Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.

  \item Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.

  \item Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.

  \item Critique: if possible include your comments and reflections about the  exercise, whether you felt you learnt something, ideas for improvements and  other thoughts you've made when solving the exercise. We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.

  \item Try to establish a practice where you log your work at the  computerlab. You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Format for electronic delivery of report and programs}

The preferred format for the report is a PDF file. You can also use DOC or postscript formats or as an ipython notebook file.  As programming language we prefer that you choose between C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python. The following prescription should be followed when preparing the report:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use Devilry to hand in your projects, log in  at  \href{{http://devilry.ifi.uio.no}}{\nolinkurl{http://devilry.ifi.uio.no}} with your normal UiO username and password and choose either 'fysstk3155' or 'fysstk4155'. There you can load up the files within the deadline.

  \item Upload \textbf{only} the report file!  For the source code file(s) you have developed please provide us with your link to your github domain.  The report file should include all of your discussions and a list of the codes you have developed.  Do not include library files which are available at the course homepage, unless you have made specific changes to them.

  \item In your git repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters.

  \item In this and all later projects, you should include tests (for example unit tests) of your code(s).

  \item Comments  from us on your projects, approval or not, corrections to be made  etc can be found under your Devilry domain and are only visible to you and the teachers of the course.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Finally, 
we encourage you to collaborate. Optimal working groups consist of 
2-3 students. You can then hand in a common report. 



\subsection{Software and needed installations}

If you have Python installed (we recommend Python3) and you feel pretty familiar with installing different packages, 
we recommend that you install the following Python packages via \textbf{pip} as
\begin{enumerate}
\item pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn tensorflow sympy pandas pillow
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For Python3, replace \textbf{pip} with \textbf{pip3}.

See below for a discussion of \textbf{tensorflow} and \textbf{scikit-learn}. 

For OSX users we recommend also, after having installed Xcode, to install \textbf{brew}. Brew allows 
for a seamless installation of additional software via for example
\begin{enumerate}
\item brew install python3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution
you can use \textbf{pip} as well and simply install Python as 
\begin{enumerate}
\item sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for python2.7)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
etc etc. 

If you don't want to install various Python packages with their dependencies separately, we recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up  all relevant dependencies for Python, namely
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{{https://docs.anaconda.com/}}{Anaconda} Anaconda is an open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system \textbf{conda}

\item \href{{https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/}}{Enthought canopy}  is a Python distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial license.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Popular software packages written in Python for ML are

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/}}{Scikit-learn}, 

\item \href{{https://www.tensorflow.org/}}{Tensorflow},

\item \href{{http://pytorch.org/}}{PyTorch} and 

\item \href{{https://keras.io/}}{Keras}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These are all freely available at their respective GitHub sites. They 
encompass communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number
of code developers and contributors keeps increasing.
