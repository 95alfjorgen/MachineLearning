    "\n",
    "Ideally the sequence $\\{ \\mathbf{x}_k \\}_{k=0}$ converges to a global minimum of the function $F$. In general we do not know if we are in a global or local minimum. In the special case when $F$ is a convex function, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case gradient descent can converge to the global solution. The advantage of this scheme is that it is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. However the method in this form has some severe limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learing we are often faced with non-convex high dimensional cost functions with many local minimum. Since GD is deterministic we will get stuck in a local minimum, if the method converges, unless we have a very good intial guess. This also implies that the scheme is sensitive to the chosen initial condition.\n",

    "## The sensitiveness of the gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "GD is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\\gamma_k$. This is due\n",
    "to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \\leq\n",
    "F(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ for sufficiently small $\\gamma_k$. The problem is to\n",

If $\\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \\neq x_2$ and $t\\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.\n",
