    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to\n",
    "learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is that there\n",
    "exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad\n",
    "class of data sets without having to write code specifically for each\n",
    "problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later\n",
    "years, found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including\n",
    "bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artificial neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of artificial neural networks has a long history of\n",
    "development, and is closely connected with the advancement of computer\n",
    "science and computers in general. A model of artificial neurons was\n",
    "first developed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 to study signal\n",
    "processing in the brain and has later been refined by others. The\n",
    "general idea is to mimic neural networks in the human brain, which is\n",
    "composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other by\n",
    "sending electrical signals.  Each neuron accumulates its incoming\n",
    "signals, which must exceed an activation threshold to yield an\n",
    "output. If the threshold is not overcome, the neuron remains inactive,\n",
    "i.e. has zero output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour has inspired a simple mathematical model for an artificial neuron."

    "\n",
    "Conceptually, it is helpful to divide neural networks into four\n",

    "1. general purpose neural networks for supervised learning,\n",

    "2. neural networks designed specifically for image processing, the most prominent example of this class being Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\n",

    "DNNs also found place in the study of quantum, and in scattering theory to learn\n",
    "$s$-wave scattering length of potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (NN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or *nodes*.  It is supposed\n",
    "to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each neuron interact\n",
    "with other neurons by sending signals in the form of mathematical\n",
    "functions between layers.  A wide variety of different NNs have been\n",
    "developed, but most of them consist of an input layer, an output layer\n",
    "and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden layers*. All layers can\n",
    "contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each connection between two\n",
    "nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type of NN devised. In this network, \n",
    "the information moves in only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the connections between the nodes, including the \n",
    "direction of information flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable, not displayed here. \n",
    "We observe that each node in a layer is connected to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, \n",
    "making this a so-called *fully-connected* FFNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks* (CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern\n",
    "inspired by the animal visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to stimuli from\n",
    "small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of each neuron can be approximated mathematically \n",
    "as a convolution operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs emulate the behaviour of neurons in the visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern\n",
    "between nodes of adjacent layers: Each node\n",
    "in a convolutional layer is connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, \n",
    "in contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.\n",
    "Often, CNNs \n",
    "consist of several convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a fully-connected layer at the end, \n",
    "which gathers all the local data and produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned NNs where information flows in one direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on\n",
    "the other hand, have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This creates a form of \n",
    "internal memory which are able to capture information on what has been calculated before; the output is dependent \n",
    "on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of sequential information by performing the same task for \n",
    "every element in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An example of such information is \n",
    "sentences, making recurrent NNs especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of NNs that have been developed. One type that is specifically designed for interpolation\n",
    "in multidimensional space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically made up of three layers: \n",
    "an input layer, a hidden layer with non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output layer (''linear'' here\n",
    "means that each node in the output layer has a linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected and \n",
    "there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as\n",
    "a separate type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of NNs could also be mentioned, but are outside the scope of this work. We will now move on to a detailed description\n",
    "of how a fully-connected FFNN works, and how it can be used to interpolate data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One use often so-called  fully-connected feed-forward neural networks with three\n",
    "or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer)\n",
    "consisting of neurons that have non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why multilayer perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward neural network with just a single hidden layer containing \n",
    "a finite number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional function to arbitrary accuracy, \n",
    "assuming the activation function for the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and monotonically-increasing continuous function**.\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to the hidden layer, the output nodes are always\n",
    "assumed to be linear, so as to not restrict the range of output values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that this theorem is only applicable to a NN with *one* hidden layer. \n",
    "Therefore, we can easily construct an NN \n",
    "that employs activation functions which do not satisfy the above requirements, as long as we have at least one layer\n",
    "with activation functions that *do*. Furthermore, although the universal approximation theorem\n",
    "lays the theoretical foundation for regression with neural networks, it does not say anything about how things work in practice: \n",
    "A neural network can still be able to approximate a given function reasonably well without having the flexibility to fit *all other*\n",
    "functions. \n",
