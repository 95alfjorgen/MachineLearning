    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boltzmann Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use a generative model rather than the more well known discriminative deep neural networks (DNN)? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Discriminitave methods have several limitations: They are mainly supervised learning methods, thus requiring labeled data. And there are tasks they cannot accomplish, like drawing new examples from an unknown probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example\n",
    "\n",
    " a. A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    " b. Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.\n",
    "\n",
    " c. Model the trial wave function for Monte Carlo calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some similarities and differences from DNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "History: The RBM was developed by amongst others Geoffrey Hinton, called by some the \"Godfather of Deep Learning\", working with the University of Toronto and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The structure of the RBM network\n",

    "\n",
    "## The network\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network layers**:\n",
    " 1. A function $\\mathbf{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. The function $\\mathbf{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called \"feature detectors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized over (integrated out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of this trick being employed in physics: \n",
    " 1. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. The introduction of ghost fields in gauge theory\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Shadow wave functions in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "**The network parameters, to be optimized/learned**:\n",
    " 1. $\\mathbf{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. $\\mathbf{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\\mathbf{h}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\\times N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joint distribution and the Energy function\n",
    "The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution"

Doing this while having intialized $\\boldsymbol{x}$ with a training data vector is referred to as contrastive divergence (CD), because one is then closer to approximating the gradient of this function than the negative log-likelihood. The contrastive divergence function is the difference between two Kullback-Leibler divergences (also called relative entropy), which measure how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution (in this case the estimated one from the ground truth one).\n",

    "\n",
    "* There are still interesting open problems, including fundamental questions ranging from the dynamical properties of high-dimensional systems to the exact ground-state properties of strongly interacting fermions.\n",

    "## Choose the right RBM\n",
    "\n",
    "Carleo and Troyer applied the RBM to the quantum mechanical spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with encouraging results. Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing the wave function\n",
    "The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{h}$"
