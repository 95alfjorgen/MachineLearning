<h2 id="___sec16">What's the future like?  </h2>

<p>
Based on multi-layer nonlinear neural networks, deep learning can
learn directly from raw data, automatically extract and abstract
features from layer to layer, and then achieve the goal of regression,
classification, or ranking. Deep learning has made breakthroughs in
computer vision, speech processing and natural language, and reached
or even surpassed human level. The success of deep learning is mainly
due to the three factors: big data, big model, and big computing.

<p>
In the past few decades, many different architectures of deep neural
networks have been proposed, such as

<ol>
<li> Convolutional neural networks, which are mostly used in image and video data processing, and have also been applied to sequential data such as text processing;</li>
<li> Recurrent neural networks, which can process sequential data of variable length and have been widely used in natural language understanding and speech processing;</li>
<li> Encoder-decoder framework, which is mostly used for image or sequence generation, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning.</li>
</ol>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec17">Bayesian Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
This is an important topic if we aim at extracting a probability
distribution. This gives us also a confidence interval and error
estimates.

<p>
Bayesian machine learning allows us to encode our prior beliefs about
what those models should look like, independent of what the data tells
us. This is especially useful when we don&#8217;t have a ton of data to
confidently learn our model.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec18">Reinforcement Learning </h2>

<p>
Reinforcement learning is a sub-area of machine learning. It studies
how agents take actions based on trial and error, so as to maximize
some notion of cumulative reward in a dynamic system or
environment. Due to its generality, the problem has also been studied
in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory,
operations research, information theory, multi-agent systems, swarm
intelligence, statistics, and genetic algorithms.

<p>
In March 2016, AlphaGo, a computer program that plays the board game
Go, beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match. This was the first time a
computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan (highest rank) professional
without handicaps. AlphaGo is based on deep convolutional neural
networks and reinforcement learning. AlphaGo&#8217;s victory was a major
milestone in artificial intelligence and it has also made
reinforcement learning a hot research area in the field of machine
learning.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec19">Transfer learning </h2>

<p>
The goal of transfer learning is to transfer the model or knowledge
obtained from a source task to the target task, in order to resolve
the issues of insufficient training data in the target task. The
rationality of doing so lies in that usually the source and target
tasks have inter-correlations, and therefore either the features,
samples, or models in the source task might provide useful information
for us to better solve the target task. Transfer learning is a hot
research topic in recent years, with many problems still waiting to be
solved in this space.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec20">Adversarial learning </h2>

<p>
The conventional deep generative model has a potential problem: the
model tends to generate extreme instances to maximize the
probabilistic likelihood, which will hurt its performance. Adversarial
learning utilizes the adversarial behaviors (e.g., generating
adversarial instances or training an adversarial model) to enhance the
robustness of the model and improve the quality of the generated
data. In recent years, one of the most promising unsupervised learning
technologies, generative adversarial networks (GAN), has already been
successfully applied to image, speech, and text.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec21">Dual learning </h2>

<p>
Dual learning is a new learning paradigm, the basic idea of which is
to use the primal-dual structure between machine learning tasks to
obtain effective feedback/regularization, and guide and strengthen the
learning process, thus reducing the requirement of large-scale labeled
data for deep learning. The idea of dual learning has been applied to
many problems in machine learning, including machine translation,
image style conversion, question answering and generation, image
classification and generation, text classification and generation,
image-to-text, and text-to-image.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec22">Distributed machine learning </h2>

<p>
Distributed computation will speed up machine learning algorithms,
significantly improve their efficiency, and thus enlarge their
application. When distributed meets machine learning, more than just
implementing the machine learning algorithms in parallel is required.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec23">Meta learning </h2>

<p>
Meta learning is an emerging research direction in machine
learning. Roughly speaking, meta learning concerns learning how to
learn, and focuses on the understanding and adaptation of the learning
itself, instead of just completing a specific learning task. That is,
a meta learner needs to be able to evaluate its own learning methods
and adjust its own learning methods according to specific learning
tasks.

<h2 id="___sec24">The Challenges Facing Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
While there has been much progress in machine learning, there are also challenges.

<p>
For example, the mainstream machine learning technologies are
black-box approaches, making us concerned about their potential
risks. To tackle this challenge, we may want to make machine learning
more explainable and controllable. As another example, the
computational complexity of machine learning algorithms is usually
very high and we may want to invent lightweight algorithms or
implementations. Furthermore, in many domains such as physics,
chemistry, biology, and social sciences, people usually seek elegantly
simple equations (e.g., the Schr&#246;dinger equation) to uncover the
underlying laws behind various phenomena. In the field of machine
learning, can we reveal simple laws instead of designing more complex
models for data fitting? Although there are many challenges, we are
still very optimistic about the future of machine learning. As we look
forward to the future, here are what we think the research hotspots in
the next ten years will be.

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec25">Explainable machine learning </h2>

<p>
Machine learning, especially deep learning, evolves rapidly. The
ability gap between machine and human on many complex cognitive tasks
becomes narrower and narrower. However, we are still in the very early
stage in terms of explaining why those effective models work and how
they work.

<p>
What is missing: the gap between correlation and causation Most
machine learning techniques, especially the statistical ones, depend
highly on data correlation to make predictions and analyses. In
contrast, rational humans tend to reply on clear and trustworthy
causality relations obtained via logical reasoning on real and clear
facts. It is one of the core goals of explainable machine learning to
transition from solving problems by data correlation to solving
problems by logical reasoning.

<h2 id="___sec26">Quantum machine learning </h2>

<p>
Quantum machine learning is an emerging interdisciplinary research
area at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.

<p>
Quantum computers use effects such as quantum coherence and quantum
entanglement to process information, which is fundamentally different
from classical computers. Quantum algorithms have surpassed the best
classical algorithms in several problems (e.g., searching for an
unsorted database, inverting a sparse matrix), which we call quantum
acceleration.

<p>
When quantum computing meets machine learning, it can be a mutually
beneficial and reinforcing process, as it allows us to take advantage
of quantum computing to improve the performance of classical machine
learning algorithms. In addition, we can also use the machine learning
algorithms (on classic computers) to analyze and improve quantum
computing systems.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec27">Quantum machine learning algorithms based on linear algebra </h2>

<p>
Many quantum machine learning algorithms are based on variants of
quantum algorithms for solving linear equations, which can efficiently
solve N-variable linear equations with complexity of O(log2 N) under
certain conditions. The quantum matrix inversion algorithm can
accelerate many machine learning methods, such as least square linear
regression, least square version of support vector machine, Gaussian
process, and more. The training of these algorithms can be simplified
to solve linear equations. The key bottleneck of this type of quantum
machine learning algorithms is data input&#8212;that is, how to initialize
the quantum system with the entire data set. Although efficient
data-input algorithms exist for certain situations, how to efficiently
input data into a quantum system is as yet unknown for most cases.

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec28">Quantum reinforcement learning </h2>

<p>
In quantum reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with the
classical environment to obtain rewards from the environment, so as to
adjust and improve its behavioral strategies. In some cases, it
achieves quantum acceleration by the quantum processing capabilities
of the agent or the possibility of exploring the environment through
quantum superposition. Such algorithms have been proposed in
superconducting circuits and systems of trapped ions.

<h2 id="___sec29">Quantum deep learning </h2>

<p>
Dedicated quantum information processors, such as quantum annealers
and programmable photonic circuits, are well suited for building deep
quantum networks. The simplest deep quantum network is the Boltzmann
machine. The classical Boltzmann machine consists of bits with tunable
interactions and is trained by adjusting the interaction of these bits
so that the distribution of its expression conforms to the statistics
of the data. To quantize the Boltzmann machine, the neural network can
simply be represented as a set of interacting quantum spins that
correspond to an adjustable Ising model. Then, by initializing the
input neurons in the Boltzmann machine to a fixed state and allowing
the system to heat up, we can read out the output qubits to get the
result.

<h2 id="___sec30">Social machine learning </h2>

<p>
Machine learning aims to imitate how humans
learn. While we have developed successful machine learning algorithms,
until now we have ignored one important fact: humans are social. Each
of us is one part of the total society and it is difficult for us to
live, learn, and improve ourselves, alone and isolated. Therefore, we
should design machines with social properties. Can we let machines
evolve by imitating human society so as to achieve more effective,
intelligent, interpretable &#8220;social machine learning&#8221;?

<p>
And much more.

<h2 id="___sec31">The last words? </h2>

<p>
Early computer scientist Alan Kay said, <b>The best way to predict the
future is to create it</b>. Therefore, all machine learning
practitioners, whether scholars or engineers, professors or students,
need to work together to advance these important research
topics. Together, we will not just predict the future, but create it.
