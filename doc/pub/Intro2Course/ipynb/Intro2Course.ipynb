    "\n",
    "## Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Three compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using [devilry](https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/) to hand in projects and [Git](https://github.com/) for repository and all your material.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Evaluation and grading: The three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The last project is organized as a workshop (duration approx 5-6 hours toward the end of the semester) where each group submits a proposal for a data sets to be analyzed with the different methods discussed during the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Each group submits a proposal or works with suggested (by us) proposals for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. Each group makes a poster and presents this to all other participants of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. Poster session where all participants can study and discuss the other proposals (the three best posters get additional score)\n",
    "\n",
    "   d. Based on feedback etc, each group finalizes the report and submits for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. Python is the default programming language, but feel free to use C/C++ and/or Fortran. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and [github address](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/tree/master/doc/Programs) of the course.\n",

    "The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will\n",
