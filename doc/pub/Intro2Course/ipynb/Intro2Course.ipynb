    "\n",
    "  * Evaluation and grading: The three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. For the last project Each group/participant submits a proposal or works with suggested (by us) proposals for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. If possible, we would like to organize the last project as a workshop where each group makes a poster and presents this to all other participants of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Poster session where all participants can study and discuss the other proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Based on feedback etc, each group finalizes the report and submits for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Python is the default programming language, but feel free to use C/C++ and/or Fortran or other programmin languages. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and [github address](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/tree/master/doc/Programs) of the course.\n",
