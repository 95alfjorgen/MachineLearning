===== Regression analysis, overarching aims  =====
!bblock

Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\hat{x} =[x_0, x_1,\dots, x_p]^T$. 
The first variable is called the _dependent_, the _outcome_ or the _response_ variable while the set of variables $\hat{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. 
 
A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(y\vert \hat{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $y$ with a given $\hat{x}$. The estimation of  $p(y\vert \hat{x})$ is made using a data set with 
* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* Response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* $p$ Explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\hat{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$   
 The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $y_i$ and $\hat{x}_i$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions .

===== Regression analysis, overarching aims II =====
!bblock


Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are
measured. The data from this experiment are denoted $\mathbf{X}$, with
$\mathbf{X}$ as above. The matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design
matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the
form of $\mathbf{Y}$ (also as above). The variable $\mathbf{Y}$ is
generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of
regression analysis is to explain $\mathbf{Y}$ in terms of
$\mathbf{X}$ through a functional relationship like $Y_i =
f(\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of
$f(\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship
between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$. This assumption gives rise to
the *linear regression model* where $\beta = (\beta_1, \ldots,
\beta_p)^{\top}$ is the *regression parameter*. The parameter
$\beta_j$, $j=1, \ldots, p$, represents the effect size of covariate
$j$ on the response. That is, for each unit change in covariate $j$
(while keeping the other covariates fixed) the observed change in the
response is equal to $\beta_j$.

===== General linear models  =====
!bblock
Before we proceed let us study a case from linear algebra where we aim at fitting a set of data $\hat{y}=[y_0,y_1,\dots,y_{n-1}]$. We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\hat{x}=[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. 

Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set. The perhaps simplest approach is to assume we can parametrize our function in terms of a polynomial of degree $n-1$ with $n$ points, that is
!bt
\[
y=y(x) \rightarrow y(x_i)=\tilde{y}_i+\epsilon_i=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \beta_i x_i^j+\epsilon_i,
\]
!et
where $\epsilon_i$ is the error in our approximation.

For every set of values $y_i,x_i$ we have thus the corresponding set of equations
!bt
\begin{align*}
y_0&=\beta_0+\beta_1x_0^1+\beta_2x_0^2+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_0^{n-1}+\epsilon_0\\

===== Generalizing the fitting procedure as a linear algebra problem  =====
!bblock
We are obviously not limited to the above polynomial. We could replace the various powers of $x$ with elements of Fourier series, that is, instead of $x_i^j$ we could have $\cos{(j x_i)}$ or $\sin{(j x_i)}$, or time series or other orthogonal functions.
For every set of values $y_i,x_i$ we can then generalize the equations to 
!bt
\begin{align*}
y_0&=\beta_0x_{00}+\beta_1x_{01}+\beta_2x_{02}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{0n-1}+\epsilon_0\\
y_1&=\beta_0x_{10}+\beta_1x_{11}+\beta_2x_{12}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{1n-1}+\epsilon_1\\
y_2&=\beta_0x_{20}+\beta_1x_{21}+\beta_2x_{22}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{2n-1}+\epsilon_2\\
\dots & \dots \\
y_{i}&=\beta_0x_{i0}+\beta_1x_{i1}+\beta_2x_{i2}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{in-1}+\epsilon_i\\

We redefine in turn the matrix $\hat{X}$ as

x_{n-1,0}& x_{n-1,1} &x_{n-1,2}& \dots & \dots &x_{n-1,n-1}\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\]
!et
and without loss of generality we rewrite again  our equations as
!bt
\[
\hat{y} = \hat{X}\hat{\beta}+\hat{\epsilon}.
\]
!et
The left-hand side of this equation forms know. Our error vector $\hat{\epsilon}$ and the parameter vector $\hat{\beta}$ are our unknow quantities. How can we obtain the optimal set of $\beta_i$ values?

===== Optimizing our parameters, more details  =====
!bblock
We well use this matrix to define the approximation $\hat{\tilde{y}}$ via the unknown quantity $\hat{\beta}$ as
!bt
\[
\hat{\tilde{y}}= \hat{X}\hat{\beta},
\]
!et
and in order to find the optimal parameters $\beta_i$ instead of solving the above linear algebra problem, we define a function which gives a measure of the spread between the values $y_i$ (which represent hopefully the exact values) and the parametrized values $\tilde{y}_i$, namely
!bt
\[
Q(\hat{\beta})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\left(\hat{y}-\hat{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\left(\hat{y}-\hat{\tilde{y}}\right),
\]
!et
or using the matrix $\hat{X}$ as
!bt
\[
Q(\hat{\beta})=\left(\hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right)^T\left(\hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right).
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Interpretations and optimizing our parameters  =====
!bblock
The function 
!bt
\[
Q(\hat{\beta})=\left(\hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right)^T\left(\hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right),
\]
!et
can be linked to the variance of the quantity $y_i$ if we interpret the latter as the mean value of for example a numerical  experiment. When linking below with the maximum likelihood approach below, we will indeed interpret $y_i$ as a mean value
!bt
\[
y_{i}=\langle y_i \rangle = \beta_0x_{i,0}+\beta_1x_{i,1}+\beta_2x_{i,2}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}+\epsilon_i,
\]
!et
where $\langle y_i \rangle$ is the mean value. Keep in mind also that till now  we have treated $y_i$ as the exact value. Normally, the response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ the outcome of a numerical experiment or another type of experiment and is thus only an approximation to the true value. It is then always accompanied by an error estimate, often limited to a statistical error estimate given by the standard deviation discussed earlier. In the discussion here we will treat $y_i$ as our exact value for the response variable.

In order to find the parameters $\beta_i$ we will then minimize the spread of $Q(\hat{\beta})$ by requiring
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial Q(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta_j}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}\right)^2\right]=0, 
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial Q(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = -2\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{ij}\left(y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}\right)\right]=0, 
\]
!et
or in a matrix-vector form as
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial Q(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = 0 = \hat{X}^T\left( \hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right).  
\]
!et


!eblock


!split
===== Interpretations and optimizing our parameters  =====
!bblock
We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial Q(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = 0 = \hat{X}^T\left( \hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right),  
\]
!et
as
!bt
\[
\hat{X}^T\hat{y} = \hat{X}^T\hat{X}\hat{\beta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\hat{X}^T\hat{X}$ is invertible we have the solution
!bt
\[
\hat{\beta} =\left(\hat{X}^T\hat{X}\right)^{-1}\hat{X}^T\hat{y}.
\]
!et

===== Interpretations and optimizing our parameters  =====

The residuals $\hat{\epsilon}$ are in turn given by
!bt
\[
\hat{\epsilon} = \hat{y}-\hat{\tilde{y}} = \hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta},
\]
!et
and with 
!bt
\[
\hat{X}^T\left( \hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right)= 0, 
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
\hat{X}^T\hat{\epsilon}=\hat{X}^T\left( \hat{y}-\hat{X}\hat{\beta}\right)= 0, 
\]
!et
meaning that the solution for $\hat{\beta}$ is the one which minimizes the residuals.  Later we will link this with the maximum likelihood approach.

===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

Normally, the response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ the outcome of a numerical experiment or another type of experiment and is thus only an approximation to the true value. It is then always accompanied by an error estimate, often limited to a statistical error estimate given by the standard deviation discussed earlier. In the discussion here we will treat $y_i$ as our exact value for the response variable.

Introducing the standard deviation $\sigma_i$ for each measurement $y_i$, we define now the $\chi^2$ function as  
!bt
\[
\chi^2(\hat{\beta})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2}{\sigma_i^2}=\left(\hat{y}-\hat{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\frac{1}{\hat{\Sigma^2}}\left(\hat{y}-\hat{\tilde{y}}\right),
\]
!et
where the matrix $\hat{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix with $\sigma_i$ as matrix elements. 

!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

In order to find the parameters $\beta_i$ we will then minimize the spread of $\chi^2(\hat{\beta})$ by requiring
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta_j}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}}{\sigma_i}\right)^2\right]=0, 
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = -2\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_{ij}}{\sigma_i}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}}{\sigma_i}\right)\right]=0, 
\]
!et
or in a matrix-vector form as
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = 0 = \hat{A}^T\left( \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{\beta}\right).  
\]
!et
where we have defined the matrix $\hat{A} =\hat{X}/\hat{\Sigma}$ with matrix elements $a_{ij} = x_{ij}/\sigma_i$ and the vector $\hat{b}$ with elements $b_i = y_i/\sigma_i$.   
!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \hat{\beta}} = 0 = \hat{A}^T\left( \hat{b}-\hat{A}\hat{\beta}\right),  
\]
!et
as
!bt
\[
\hat{A}^T\hat{b} = \hat{A}^T\hat{A}\hat{\beta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\hat{A}^T\hat{A}$ is invertible we have the solution
!bt
\[
\hat{\beta} =\left(\hat{A}^T\hat{A}\right)^{-1}\hat{A}^T\hat{b}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

If we then introduce the matrix
!bt
\[
\hat{H} =  \left(\hat{A}^T\hat{A}\right)^{-1},
\]
!et
we have then the following expression for the parameters $\beta_j$ (the matrix elements of $\hat{H}$ are $h_{ij}$)
!bt
\[
\beta_j = \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{y_i}{\sigma_i}\frac{x_{ik}}{\sigma_i} = \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}b_ia_{ik}
\]
!et
We state without proof the expression for the uncertainty  in the parameters $\beta_j$ as (we leave this as an exercise)
!bt
\[
\sigma^2(\beta_j) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma_i^2\left( \frac{\partial \beta_j}{\partial y_i}\right)^2, 
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
\sigma^2(\beta_j) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_{ik}\right)\left(\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}h_{jl}\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}a_{ml}\right) = h_{jj}!
\]

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock
The first step here is to approximate the function $y$ with a first-order polynomial, that is we write
!bt
\[
y=y(x) \rightarrow y(x_i) \approx \beta_0+\beta_1 x_i.
\]
!et
By computing the derivatives of $\chi^2$ with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ show that these are given by
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -2\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\right]=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\hat{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -2\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\right]=0.
\]

===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====

For a linear fit we don't need to invert a matrix!!  
Defining
!bt
\[
\gamma =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2},

!et

!bt
\[
\gamma_x =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},

\[
\gamma_{xx} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_ix_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\gamma_{xy} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{y_ix_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},
\]
!et
we obtain
!bt
\[
\beta_0 = \frac{\gamma_{xx}\gamma_y-\gamma_x\gamma_y}{\gamma\gamma_{xx}-\gamma_x^2},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\beta_1 = \frac{\gamma_{xy}\gamma-\gamma_x\gamma_y}{\gamma\gamma_{xx}-\gamma_x^2}.
\]
!et

This approach (different linear and non-linear regression) suffers often from both being underdetermined and overdetermined in the unknown coefficients $\beta_i$.  A better approach is to use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method discussed below. Or using Lasso and Ridge regression. See below.

===== Simple regression model =====
We are now ready to write our first program which aims at solving the above linear regression equations. We start with data we have produced ourselves, in this case normally distributed random numbers along the $x$-axis. These numbers define then the value of a function $y(x)=4+3x+N(0,1)$. Thereafter we order the $x$ values and employ our linear regression algorithm to set up the best fit. Here we find it useful to use the numpy function $c\_$ arrays where arrays are stacked along their last axis after being upgraded to at least two dimensions with ones post-pended to the shape. The following examples help in understanding what happens 
!bc pycod 
import numpy as np
print(np.c_[np.array([1,2,3]), np.array([4,5,6])])
print(np.c_[np.array([[1,2,3]]), 0, 0, np.array([[4,5,6]])])
!ec

!bc pycod
# Importing various packages
from random import random, seed
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = 2*np.random.rand(100,1)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.randn(100,1)

xb = np.c_[np.ones((100,1)), x]
beta = np.linalg.inv(xb.T.dot(xb)).dot(xb.T).dot(y)
xnew = np.array([[0],[2]])
xbnew = np.c_[np.ones((2,1)), xnew]
ypredict = xbnew.dot(beta)

plt.plot(xnew, ypredict, "r-")
plt.plot(x, y ,'ro')
plt.axis([0,2.0,0, 15.0])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$y$')
plt.title(r'Linear Regression')
plt.show()

!ec

We see that, as expected, a linear fit gives a seemingly (from the graph) good representation of the data.

===== Simple linear regression model using _scikit-learn_ =====

We start with perhaps our simplest possible example, using _scikit-learn_ to perform linear regression analysis on a data set produced by us. 
What follows is a simple Python code where we have defined  function $y$ in terms of the variable $x$. Both are defined as vectors of dimension $1\times 100$. The entries to the vector $\hat{x}$  are given by random numbers generated with a uniform distribution with entries $x_i \in [0,1]$ (more about probability distribution functions later). These values are then used to define a function $y(x)$ (tabulated again as a vector) with a linear dependence on $x$ plus a random noise added via the normal distribution.


The Numpy functions are imported used the _import numpy as np_
statement and the random number generator for the uniform distribution
is called using the function _np.random.rand()_, where we specificy
that we want $100$ random variables.  Using Numpy we define
automatically an array with the specified number of elements, $100$ in
our case.  With the Numpy function _randn()_ we can compute random
numbers with the normal distribution (mean value $\mu$ equal to zero and
variance $\sigma^2$ set to one) and produce the values of $y$ assuming a linear
dependence as function of $x$

!bt
\[
y = 2x+N(0,1),
\]
!et

where $N(0,1)$ represents random numbers generated by the normal
distribution.  From _scikit-learn_ we import then the
_LinearRegression_ functionality and make a prediction $\tilde{y} =
\alpha + \beta x$ using the function _fit(x,y)_. We call the set of
data $(\hat{x},\hat{y})$ for our training data. The Python package
_scikit-learn_ has also a functionality which extracts the above
fitting parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see below). Later we will
distinguish between training data and test data.

For plotting we use the Python package
"matplotlib":"https://matplotlib.org/" which produces publication
quality figures. Feel free to explore the extensive
"gallery":"https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html" of examples. In
this example we plot our original values of $x$ and $y$ as well as the
prediction _ypredict_ ($\tilde{y}$), which attempts at fitting our
data with a straight line.

The Python code follows here.

===== Simple linear regression model  =====

This example serves several aims. It allows us to demonstrate several
aspects of data analysis and later machine learning algorithms. The
immediate visualization shows that our linear fit is not
impressive. It goes through the data points, but there are many
outliers which are not reproduced by our linear regression.  We could
now play around with this small program and change for example the
factor in front of $x$ and the normal distribution.  Try to change the
function $y$ to

y = 10x+0.01 \times N(0,1),

where $x$ is defined as before.  


!split
===== Less noise =====

Does the fit look better? Indeed, by
reducing the role of the normal distribution we see immediately that
our linear prediction seemingly reproduces better the training
set. However, this testing 'by the eye' is obviouly not satisfactory in the
long run. Here we have only defined the training data and our model, and 
have not discussed a more rigorous approach to the _cost_ function.


!split
===== How to study our fits =====

We need more rigorous criteria in defining whether we have succeeded or
not in modeling our training data.  You will be surprised to see that
many scientists seldomly venture beyond this 'by the eye' approach. A
standard approach for the *cost* function is the so-called $\chi^2$
function 

!bt 
\[ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}, 
\] 
!et 

where $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance (to be defined later) of the entry
$y_i$.  We may not know the explicit value of $\sigma_i^2$, it serves
however the aim of scaling the equations and make the cost function
dimensionless.  


!split
===== Minimizing the cost function =====

Minimizing the cost function is a central aspect of
our discussions to come. Finding its minima as function of the model
parameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ in our case) will be a recurring
theme in these series of lectures. Essentially all machine learning
algorithms we will discuss center around the minimization of the
chosen cost function. This depends in turn on our specific
model for describing the data, a typical situation in supervised
learning. Automatizing the search for the minima of the cost function is a
central ingredient in all algorithms. Typical methods which are
employed are various variants of _gradient_ methods. These will be
discussed in more detail later. Again, you'll be surprised to hear that
many practitioners minimize the above function ''by the eye', popularly dubbed as 
'chi by the eye'. That is, change a parameter and see (visually and numerically) that 
the  $\chi^2$ function becomes smaller. 

!split
===== Relative error =====

There are many ways to define the cost function. A simpler approach is to look at the relative difference between the training data and the predicted data, that is we define 
the relative error as

!bt
\[
\epsilon_{\mathrm{relative}}= \frac{\vert \hat{y} -\hat{\tilde{y}}\vert}{\vert \hat{y}\vert}.
\]
!et
We can modify easily the above Python code and plot the relative error instead
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

x = np.random.rand(100,1)
y = 5*x+0.01*np.random.randn(100,1)
linreg = LinearRegression()
linreg.fit(x,y)
ypredict = linreg.predict(x)

plt.plot(x, np.abs(ypredict-y)/abs(y), "ro")
plt.axis([0,1.0,0.0, 0.5])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$\epsilon_{\mathrm{relative}}$')
plt.title(r'Relative error')
plt.show()
!ec

Depending on the parameter in front of the normal distribution, we may
have a small or larger relative error. Try to play around with
different training data sets and study (graphically) the value of the
relative error.


!split
===== The richness of _scikit-learn_ =====

As mentioned above, _scikit-learn_ has an impressive functionality.
We can for example extract the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and
their error estimates, or the variance and standard deviation and many
other properties from the statistical data analysis. 

Here we show an
example of the functionality of scikit-learn.
!bc pycod

!split
===== Functions in _scikit-learn_ =====

The function _coef_ gives us the parameter $\beta$ of our fit while _intercept_ yields 
$\alpha$. Depending on the constant in front of the normal distribution, we get values near or far from $alpha =2$ and $\beta =5$. Try to play around with different parameters in front of the normal distribution. The function _meansquarederror_ gives us the mean square error, a risk metric corresponding to the expected value of the squared (quadratic) error or loss defined as
!bt 
\[ MSE(\hat{y},\hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2, 
\] 
!et 

The smaller the value, the better the fit. Ideally we would like to
have an MSE equal zero.  The attentive reader has probably recognized
this function as being similar to the $\chi^2$ function defined above.

!split
===== Other functions in  _scikit-learn_ =====

The _r2score_ function computes $R^2$, the coefficient of
determination. It provides a measure of how well future samples are
likely to be predicted by the model. Best possible score is 1.0 and it
can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A
constant model that always predicts the expected value of $\hat{y}$,
disregarding the input features, would get a $R^2$ score of $0.0$.

If $\tilde{\hat{y}}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i-th$ sample and $y_i$ is the corresponding true value, then the score $R^2$ is defined as
!bt
\[
R^2(\hat{y}, \tilde{\hat{y}}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \tilde{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2},
\]
!et
where we have defined the mean value  of $\hat{y}$ as
!bt
\[
\bar{y} =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} y_i.
\]
!et

!split
===== The mean absolute error and other functions in  _scikit-learn_ =====

Another quantity will meet again in our discussions of regression analysis is 
 mean absolute error (MAE), a risk metric corresponding to the expected value of the absolute error loss or what we call the $l1$-norm loss. In our discussion above we presented the relative error.
The MAE is defined as follows
!bt
\[
\text{MAE}(\hat{y}, \hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left| y_i - \tilde{y}_i \right|.
\]
!et
Finally we present the 
squared logarithmic (quadratic) error
!bt
\[
\text{MSLE}(\hat{y}, \hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (\log_e (1 + y_i) - \log_e (1 + \tilde{y}_i) )^2,
\]
!et

where $\log_e (x)$ stands for the natural logarithm of $x$. This error
estimate is best to use when targets having exponential growth, such
as population counts, average sales of a commodity over a span of
years etc. 


!split
===== Cubic polynomial in  _scikit-learn_ =====

We will discuss in more
detail these and other functions in the various lectures.  We conclude this part with another example. Instead of 
a linear $x$-dependence we study now a cubic polynomial and use the polynomial regression analysis tools of scikit-learn. 
Add description of the various python commands.

===== Linking the regression analysis with a statistical interpretation =====

Before we proceed, and to link with our discussions of Bayesian statistics to come, it is useful the derive the standard regression analysis equations using a statistical interpretation. This allows us also to derive quantities like the variance and other expectation values in a rather straightforward way. 

It is assumed that $\varepsilon_i
\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and the $\varepsilon_{i}$ are
independent, i.e.: 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mbox{Cov}(\varepsilon_{i_1},
\varepsilon_{i_2}) & = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc} \sigma^2 & \mbox{if}
& i_1 = i_2, \\ 0 & \mbox{if} & i_1 \not= i_2.  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*} 
!et
The randomness of $\varepsilon_i$ implies that
$\mathbf{Y}_i$ is also a random variable. In particular,
$\mathbf{Y}_i$ is normally distributed, because $\varepsilon_i \sim
\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast} \, \beta$ is a
non-random scalar. To specify the parameters of the distribution of
$\mathbf{Y}_i$ we need to calculate its first two moments. 

!split
===== Expectation value and variance =====

Its expectation equals: 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mathbb{E}(Y_i) & =
\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta) + \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i)
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta, 
\end{align*} 
!et
while
its variance is 
!bt
\begin{align*} \mbox{Var}(Y_i) & = \mathbb{E} \{ [Y_i
- \mathbb{E}(Y_i)]^2 \} \, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbb{E} ( Y_i^2 ) -
[\mathbb{E}(Y_i)]^2  \\  & = \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \,
\beta + \varepsilon_i )^2] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta)^2 \\ &
= \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta)^2 + 2 \varepsilon_i
\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta + \varepsilon_i^2 ] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i,
\ast} \, \beta)^2 \\  & = ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta)^2 + 2
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i) \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta +
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta)^2 
\\ & = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) \, \, \, = \, \, \,
\mbox{Var}(\varepsilon_i) \, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2.  
\end{align*}
!et
Hence, $Y_i \sim \mathcal{N}( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta, \sigma^2)$.

!split
===== From standard regression to Ridge regressions =====

One of the typical problems we encounter with linear regression, in particular 
when the matrix $\hat{X}$ (our so-called design matrix) is high-dimensional, 
are problems with near singular or singular matrices. The column vectors of $\hat{X}$ 
may be linearly dependent, normally referred to as super-collinearity.  
This means that the matrix may be rank deficient and it is basically impossible to 
to model the data using linear regression. As an example, consider the matrix
!bt
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{X} & =  \left[
\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & -1 & 2
\\
1 & 0 & 1
\\
1 & 2  & -1
\\
1 & 1  & 0
\end{array} \right]
\end{align*}
!et

The columns of $\hat{X}$ are linearly dependent. We se this easily since the 
the first column is the row-wise sum of the other two columns. The rank (more correct,
the column rank) of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by the
column vectors. Hence, the rank of $\mathbf{X}$ is equal to the number
of linearly independent columns. In this particular case the matrix has rank 2.

Super-collinearity of an $(n \times p)$-dimensional design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ implies
that the inverse of the matrix $\hat{X}^T\hat{x}$ (the matrix we needto invert to solve the linear regression equations) is non-invertible. If we have a square matrix that does not have an inverse, we say this matrix singular. The example here demonstrates this
!bt
\begin{align*}
\hat{X} & =  \left[
\begin{array}{rr}
1 & -1
\\
1 & -1
\end{array} \right].
\end{align*}
!et
We see easily that  $\mbox{det}(\hat{X}) = x_{11} x_{22} - x_{12} x_{21} = 1 \times (-1) - 1 \times (-1) = 0$. Hence, $\mathbf{X}$ is singular and its inverse is undefined.
This is equivalent to saying that the matrix $\hat{X}$ has at least an eigenvalue which is zero.

!split
===== Fixing the singularity =====

If our design matrix $\hat{X}$ which enters the linear regression problem
!bt
\begin{align}
\hat{\beta} & =  (\hat{X}^{T} \hat{X})^{-1} \hat{X}^{T} \hat{y},
\end{align}
!et
has linearly dependent column vectors, we will not be able to compute the inverse
of $\hat{X}^T\hat{X}$ and we cannot find the parameters (estimators) $\beta_i$. 
The estimators are only well-defined if $(\hat{X}^{T}\hat{X})^{-1}$ exits. 
This is more likely to happen when the matrix $\hat{X}$ is high-dimensional. In this case it is likely to encounter a situation where 
the regression parameters $\beta_i$ cannot be estimated.

The *ad hoc* approach which was introduced in the 70s was simply to add a diagonal component to the matrix to invert, that is we change
!bt
\[
\hat{X}^{T} \hat{X} \rightarrow \hat{X}^{T} \hat{X}+\lambda \hat{I},
\]
!et 
where $\hat{I}$ is the identity matrix.

===== Fitting vs. predicting when data is in the model class =====

We start by considering the case
$f(x)=2x$.
 
Then the data is clearly generated by a model that is contained within
all three model classes we are using to make predictions (linear
models, third order polynomials, and tenth order polynomials).

Run the code for the following cases:

o For  $f(x)=2x$ ,  $Ntrain=10$  and $\sigma =0$  (noiseless case), train the three classes of models (linear, third-order polynomial, and tenth order polynomial) for a training set when  $x \in [0,1]$ . Make graphs comparing fits for different order of polynomials. Which model fits the data the best?
o Do you think that the data that has the least error on the training set will also make the best predictions? Why or why not? Can you try to discuss and formalize your intuition? What can go right and what can go wrong?
o Check your answer by seeing how well your fits predict newly generated test data (including on data outside the range you fit on, for example  $x \in [0,1.2]$ ) using the code below. How well do you do on points in the range of  x  where you trained the model? How about points outside the original training data set?
o Repeat the above for  $f(x)=2x$ ,  $Ntrain=10$ , and  $\sigma=1$ . What changes?
Repeat the exercises above for  $f(x)=2x$ ,  $Ntrain=100$ , and  $\sigma=1$ . What changes?
Summarize what you have learned about the relationship between model complexity (number of parameters), goodness of fit on training data, and the ability to predict well.


!split
=====  Fitting versus predicting when data is not in the model class =====

Thus far, we have considered the case where the data is generated using a model contained in the model class. Now consider $f(x)=2x-10x^5+15x^{10}$ . Notice that the for linear and third-order polynomial the true model  $f(x)$  is not contained in model class.

o Do better fits lead to better predictions?
o What is the relationship between the true model for generating the data and the model class that has the most predictive power? How is this related to the model complexity? How does this depend on the number of data points  $Ntrain$  and  $\sigma$?
Summarize what you think you learned about the relationship of knowing the true model class and predictive power.
