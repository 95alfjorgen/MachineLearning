Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\hat{x} =[x_0, x_1,\dots, x_p]$. 
The first variable is called the _dependent_, the _outcome_ or the _response_ variable while the set of variables $\hat{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. 
 
A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(y\vert \hat{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $y$ with a given $\hat{x}$. The estimation of  $p(y\vert \hat{x})$ is made using a data set with 
* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* Response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* $p$ Explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\hat{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$   
 The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $y_i$ and $\hat{x}_i$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions .
