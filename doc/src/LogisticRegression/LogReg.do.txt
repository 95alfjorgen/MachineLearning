===== Logistic Regression =====

In linear regression our main interest was centered on learning the
coefficients of a functional fit (say a polynomial) in order to be
able to predict the response of a continuous variable on some unseen
data. The fit to the continuous variable $y_i$ is based on some
independent variables $\hat{x}_i$. Linear regression resulted in
analytical expressions (in terms of matrices to invert) for several
quantities, ranging from the variance and thereby the confidence
intervals of the parameters $\hat{\beta}$ to the mean squared
error. If we can invert the product of the design matrices, linear
regression gives then a simple recipe for fitting our data.


Classification problems, however, are concerned with outcomes taking
the form of discrete variables (i.e. categories). We may for example,
on the basis of DNA sequencing for a number of patients, like to find
out which mutations are important for a certain disease; or based on
scans of various patients' brains, figure out if there is a tumor or
not; or given a specific physical system, we'd like to identify its
state, say whether it is an ordered or disordered system (typical
situation in solid state physics); or classify the status of a
patient, whether she/he has a stroke or not and many other similar
situations.

The most common situation we encounter when we apply logistic
regression is that of two possible outcomes, normally denoted as a
binary outcome, true or false, positive or negative, success or
failure etc.

===== Optimization and Deep learning =====

Logistic regression will also serve as our stepping towards neural
network algorithms and supervised deep learning. For logistic
learning, the minimization of the cost function leads to a non-linear
equation in the parameters $\hat{\beta}$. The optmization of the problem calls therefore for minimization algorithms. This forms the bottle neck of all machine learning algorithms, namely how to find reliable minima of a multi-variable function. This leads us to the family of gradient descent methods. The latter are the working horses of basically all modern machine learning algorithms. 

We note also that many of the topics discussed here 
regression are also commonly used in modern supervised Deep Learning
models_, as we will see later.


!split 
===== Basics =====

We consider the case where the dependent variables, also called the
responses or the outcomes) $y_i$ are discrete and only take values
from $k=0,\dots,K-1$ (i.e. $K$ classes).

The goal is to predict the
output classes from the design matrix $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$
made of $n$ samples, each of which carries $p$ features. The
primary goal is to identify the classes to which new unseen samples
belong.
 
Let us specialize to the case of two classes only, with outputs $y_i=0$ and $y_i=1$. Our outcomes could represent the status of a credit card use who could default or not on her/his debt. That is
!bt
\[
y_i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathrm{no default}\\  1 & \mathrm{default} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et



!split
===== Linear classifier =====

Before moving to the logistic model, let us try to use our linear regression model to classify these two outcomes. We could for example fit a linear model to the default case if $y_i > 0.5$ and the no default case $y_i \leq 0.5$. 

We would then have our 
weighted linear combination, namely 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \hat{X}_i^T\hat{\beta} +  \hat{\epsilon},
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{y}$ is a vector representing the possible outcomes, $\hat{X}$ is our
$n\times p$ design matrix and $\hat{\beta}$ represents our estimators.

!split
===== Some selected properties =====

The main problem with our  function is that it 
takes values on the entire real axis. In the case of
logistic regression, however, the labels $y_i$ are discrete
variables. One simple way to get a discrete output is to have sign
functions that map the output of a linear regressor to values $\{0,1\}$,
$f(s_i)=sign(s_i)=1$ if $s_i\ge 0$ and 0 if otherwise. 
We will encounter this model in our first demonstration of neural networks. Historically it is called the ``perceptron" model in the machine learning
literature. This model is extremely simple. However, in many cases it is more
favorable to use a ``soft" classifier that outputs
the probability of a given category. This leads us to the logistic function.

!split
===== The logistic function =====

A widely used model is the so-called  logistic (or sigmoid) function which ranges from $0$ to $1$, 
!bt
\[
p(t) = \frac{1}{1+\mathrm \exp{-t}}=\frac{\exp{t}}{1+\mathrm \exp{t}}.
\]
!et
Note that $1-p(t)= p(-t)$.

!split
===== The cross-entropy as a cost function for logistic regression =====

The perceptron is an example of a ``hard classification'': each datapoint is deterministically assigned to a category (i.e $y_i=0$ or $y_i=1$). In many cases, it is favorable to have a ``soft'' classifier that outputs the probability of a given category rather than a single value. For example, given $\mathbf{x}_i$, the classifier outputs the probability of being in category $m$. 
Logistic regression is the most canonical example of a soft classifier. In logistic regression, the probability that a data point $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ belongs to a category $y_i=\{0,1\}$ is  is given by
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
P(y_i=1|\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta)} &=& \frac{1}{1+\mathrm{e}^{-\mathbf{x}^T_i\mathbf{w}}},\nonumber\\
P(y_i=0|\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta)} &=& 1 - P(y_i=1|\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta)},
\end{eqnarray}
!et
where $\boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{w}$ are the weights we wish to learn from the data. 


Notice that in terms of the logistic function, we can write
!bt
\[
P(y_i=1) =f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})=1-P(y_i=0).
\]
!et

!split 
===== Maximum likelihood =====

We now define the cost function for logistic regression using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Recall, that in MLE we choose parameters
to maximize the probability of seeing the observed data. Consider a
dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(y_i,\boldsymbol{x}_i)\}$ with binary labels
$y_i\in\{0,1\}$ where the data points are drawn independently.  The
likelihood of the seeing the data under our model is just:
!bt
\begin{align}
P(\mathcal{D}|\mathbf{w})& = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})\right]^{y_i}\left[1-f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})\right]^{1-y_i}\nonumber \\
\end{align}
!et
from which we can readily compute the log-likelihood:
!bt
\begin{equation}
l(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^n  y_i\log f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w}) + (1-y_i)\log\left[1-f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})\right].
\end{equation}
!et

!split
The maximum likelihood estimator is defined as the set of parameters that maximize the log-likelihood where we maximize with respect to $\theta$
!bt
\[
\hat{\mathbf{w}} = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i\log f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w}) + (1-y_i)\log\left[1-f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})\right]. 
\]
!et
Since the cost (error) function is just the negative log-likelihood, for logistic regression we have that
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{w}) &=& - l(\mathbf{w}) \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n  -y_i\log f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w}) - (1-y_i)\log\left[1-f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})\right].\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
!et
This equation is known in statistics as the \emph{cross entropy}. Finally, we note that just as in linear regression, 
in practice we usually supplement the cross-entropy with additional regularization terms, usually $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization as we did for Ridge and Lasso regression.

!split
=====  Minimizing the cross entropy =====

The cross entropy is a convex function of the weights $\mathbf{w}$ and,
therefore, any local minimizer is a global minimizer. Minimizing this
cost function leads to the following equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{0}=\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^n\left[f(\mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{w})-y_i\right]\mathbf{x}_i,
\end{equation} 
!et

where we made use of the logistic function identity $\partial_z f(z) =
f(z)[1-f(z)]$.  This equation defines a transcendental equation for
$\mathbf{w}$, the solution of which, unlike linear regression, cannot
be written in a closed form. 
Here we need gradient descent methods!
