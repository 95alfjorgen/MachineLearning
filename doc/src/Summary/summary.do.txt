===== Learning outcomes and overarching aims of this course =====

The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods
essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The
course is project based and through the various projects, normally
three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems
in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific
results. The students will learn to develop and structure large codes
for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities
and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and
ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. 

* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network;
* Learn about basic data analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
* Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Metropolis and Gibbs samplers and their possible applications;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and students are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.
