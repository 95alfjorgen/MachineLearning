===== Topics we have covered this year =====

The course has two central parts

o Statistical analysis and optimization of data
o Machine learning

o Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
o Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
o Central elements from linear algebra
o Gradient methods for data optimization
o Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
o Practical optimization using Singular-value decomposition and least squares for parameterizing data.
o Principal Component Analysis.

!split
===== Machine learning =====

The following topics will be covered
o Linear methods for regression and classification;
o Neural networks;
o Decisions trees, random forests, boosting and bagging
o Support vector machines

===== Learning outcomes and overarching aims of this course =====

The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods
essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The
course is project based and through the various projects, normally
three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems
in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific
results. The students will learn to develop and structure large codes
for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities
and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and
ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. 

* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network;
* Learn about baggin, boosting and trees
* Support vector machines
* Learn about basic data analysis;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.

===== Perspective on Machine Learning =====

o Rapidly emerging application area
o Experiment AND theory are evolving in many many fields. Still many low-hanging fruits.
o Requires education/retraining for more widespread adoption
o A lot of “word-of-mouth” development methods

Huge amounts of data sets require automation, classical analysis tools often inadequate. 
High energy physics hit this wall in the 90’s.
In 2009 single top quark production was determined via "Boosted decision trees, Bayesian
Neural Networks, etc.":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0850.pdf"

===== Starting your Machine Learning Project  =====

o Identify problem type: classification, generation, regression
o Consider your data carefully
o Choose a simple model that fits 1. and 2.
o Consider your data carefully again… data representation
o Based on results, feedback loop to earliest possible point




!split
===== Choose a Model and Algorithm  =====

o Supervised?
o Start with the simplest model that fits your problem
o Start with minimal processing of data

!split
===== Preparing Your Data =====

o Shuffle your data
o Mean center your data
  * Why?
o Normalize the variance
  * Why?
o _Whitening_
  * Decorrelates data
  * Can be hit or miss
o  When to do train/test split?


!split
=====  Which Activation and Weights to Choose in Neural Networks =====

o RELU? ELU?
o Sigmoid or Tanh?
o Set all weights to 0?
  * Terrible idea
o Set all weights to random values?
  * Small random values


!split
===== Optimization Methods and Hyperparameters =====
o Stochastic gradient descent
o  Stochastic gradient descent + momentum
o State-of-the-art approaches:
  * RMSProp
  * Adam

Which regularization and hyperparameters? $L_1$ or $L_2$, soft classifiers, depths of trees and many other. Need to explore a large set of hyperparameters and regularization methods. 


!split
===== Resampling =====

When do we resample?

o Bootstrap
o Cross-validation
o Jackknife and many other
