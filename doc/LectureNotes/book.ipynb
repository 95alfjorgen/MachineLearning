    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, data science and machine learning form important fields of\n",
    "research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and make\n",
    "predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract important\n",
    "correlations about physical process and the underlying laws of motion\n",
    "in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear frequently in\n",
    "essentially all disciplines, from the traditional Science, Technology,\n",
    "Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life Science, Law, education\n",
    "research, the Humanities and the Social Sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become more\n",
    "and more common to see research projects on big data in for example\n",
    "the Social Sciences where extracting patterns from complicated survey\n",
    "data is one of many research directions.  Having a solid grasp of data\n",
    "analysis and machine learning is thus becoming central to scientific\n",
    "computing in many fields, and competences and skills within the fields\n",
    "of machine learning and scientific computing are nowadays strongly\n",
    "requested by many potential employers. The latter cannot be\n",
    "overstated, familiarity with machine learning has almost become a\n",
    "prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities,\n",
    "whether they are in bioinformatics, life science, physics or finance,\n",
    "in the private or the public sector. This author has had several\n",
    "students or met students who have been hired recently based on their\n",
    "skills and competences in scientific computing and data science, often\n",
    "with marginal knowledge of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. Many of the methods we will study are also \n",
    "strongly rooted in basic mathematics and physics research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",
    "role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young\n",
    "age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in\n",
    "computational capabilities have been followed by developments of\n",
    "methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,\n",
    "relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The\n",
    "field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software packages\n",
    "written in Python for machine learning like\n",
    "[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), all\n",
    "freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass\n",
    "communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of\n",
    "code developers and contributors keeps increasing. Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",
    "justification, opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and\n",
    "trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a\n",
    "solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability\n",
    "theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte\n",
    "Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many\n",
    "of algorithms and methods we will discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These setsof lectures aim at giving you an overview of central aspects of\n",
    "statistical data analysis as well as some of the central algorithms\n",
    "used in machine learning.  We will introduce a variety of central\n",
    "algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and\n",
    "machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hands-on projects and experimenting with data and algorithms plays a central role in\n",
    "these lectures, and our hope is, through the various\n",
    "projects and exercies, to  expose you to fundamental\n",
    "research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of\n",
    "the art scientific results. You  will learn to develop and\n",
    "structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with\n",
    "computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A\n",
    "good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the\n",
    "course. More specifically, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "1. learn about basic data analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs samplers and their possible applications, from numerical integration to simulation of stock markets;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Understand methods for regression and classification;\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Learn about neural network, genetic algorithms and Boltzmann machines;\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++, in addition to a basic knowledge of linear algebra (typically taught during the first one or two years of undergraduate studies).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several topics we will cover here, spanning from a\n",
    "statistical data analysis and its basic concepts such expectation\n",
    "values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors, via\n",
    "well-known probability distribution functions like uniform\n",
    "distribution, the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution and\n",
    "simple and multivariate normal distributions to central elements of\n",
    "Bayesian statistics and modeling. We will also remind the reader about\n",
    "central elements from linear algebra and standard methods based on\n",
    "linear algebra used to fit functions such Cubic splines and gradient\n",
    "methods for data optimization and the Singular-value decomposition and\n",
    "least square methods for parameterizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also cover Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, well-known\n",
    "algorithms for sampling stochastic events like the Metropolis-Hastings\n",
    "and Gibbs sampling methods. An important aspect of all our\n",
    "calculations is a proper estimation of errors. Here we will also\n",
    "discuss famous resampling techniques like the blocking, bootstrapping\n",
    "and jackknife methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the material covers several algorithms used in\n",
    "machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we cover have three main topics in common, irrespective of\n",
    "whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning. The first\n",
    "ingredient is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into\n",
    "training and test data), the second item is a model which is normally a\n",
    "function of some parameters.  The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determin our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last ingredient is a so-called **cost**\n",
    "function which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model\n",
    "is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will build our machine learning approach on elements of the\n",
    "statistical foundation discussed above, with elements from data\n",
    "analysis, stochastic processes etc. We will discuss the following\n",
    "machine learning algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear regression and its variants, in essence polynomial regression\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision tree algorithms, from simpler to more complex ones\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Nearest neighbors models\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bayesian statistics and regression\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Support vector machines and finally various variants of\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Artifical neural networks and deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Networks for unsupervised learning using for example reduced Boltzmann machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python plays nowadays a central role in the development of machine\n",
    "learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, seen\n",
    "the wealth of machine learning and data analysis packages written in\n",
    "Python, easy to use libraries with immediate visualization(and not the\n",
    "least impressive galleries of existing example), the popularity of the\n",
    "Jupyter notebook framework with the possibility to run **R** codes or\n",
    "compiled programs written in C++, and much more made our choice of\n",
    "programming language for this series of lectures of easy. However,\n",
    "since the focus here is not only on using existing Python tools such\n",
    "as **scikit-learn** or **tensorflow**, but also on developing your own\n",
    "algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these\n",
    "algorithms eithers a Python codes or C++ codes. Finally, we will, as\n",
    "far as possible keep parallel versions of the data analysis and\n",
    "machine larning programming aspects in **R** as\n",
    "well. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language and environment\n",
    "for statistical computing and graphics which is widely used in\n",
    "statistics and mathematics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we also  focus on compiled languages like C++ (or\n",
    "Fortran), is that Python is still notoriously slow when we do not\n",
    "utilize highly streamlined computational libraries like\n",
    "[Lapack](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) or other numerical libraries\n",
    "written in compiled languages (many of these libraries are written in\n",
    "Fortran).  Although a project like [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)\n",
    "holds great promise for speeding up the unrolling of lengthy loops, C+\n",
    "and Fortran are presently still the performance winners. Numba gives\n",
    "you potentially the power to speed up your applications with high\n",
    "performance functions written directly in Python. In particular,\n",
    "array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can achieve similar\n",
    "performance to C, C++ and Fortran. However, even with these speed-ups,\n",
    "for codes involving heavy Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses and\n",
    "optimizations of cost functions, C++/C or Fortran codes tend to\n",
    "outperform Python codes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Presently thus, the community tends to let\n",
    "code written in C++/C or Fortran do the heavy duty numerical\n",
    "number crunching and leave the post-analysis of the data to the above\n",
    "mentioned Python modules or software packages.  However, with the developments taking place in for example the Python community, and seen\n",
    "the changes during the last decade, the above situation may change swiftly in the not too distant future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the examples we discuss in this series of lectures come with\n",
    "existing data files or provide code examples which produce the data to\n",
    "be analyzed.  Most of the  applications we will discuss deal with\n",
    "small data sets (less than a terabyte of information) and can easily\n",
    "be analyzed and tested  on standard off the shelf laptops you find in general \n",
    "grocery stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data handling, machine learning  and ethical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the cases we will study, we will either generate the data\n",
    "to analyze ourselves (both for supervised learning and unsupervised\n",
    "learning) or we will recur again and again to data present in say\n",
    "**scikit-learn** or **tensorflow**.  Many of the examples we end up\n",
    "dealing with are from a privacy and data protection point of view,\n",
    "rather inoccuous and boring results of numerical\n",
    "calculations. However, this does not hinder us from developing a sound\n",
    "ethical attitude to the data we use, how we analyze the data and how\n",
    "we handle the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most immediate and simplest possible ethical aspects deal with our\n",
    "approach to the scientific process. Nowadays, with version control\n",
    "software like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and various online\n",
    "repositories like [Github](https://github.com/),\n",
    "[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) etc, we can easily make our codes\n",
    "and data sets we have used, freely and easily accessible to a wider\n",
    "community. This helps us almost automagically in making our science\n",
    "reproducible. The large open-source development communities involved\n",
    "in say [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), are\n",
    "all excellent examples of this. The codes can be tested and improved\n",
    "upon continuosly, helping thereby our scientific community at large in\n",
    "developing data analysis and machine learning tools.  It is much\n",
    "easier today to gain traction and acceptance for making your science\n",
    "reproducible. From a societal stand, this is an important element\n",
    "since many of the developers are employees of large public institutions like\n",
    "universities and research labs. Our taxpayer do deserve to get\n",
    "something back for their bucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this more mechanical aspect of the ethics of science (in\n",
    "particular the reproducibility of scientific results) is something\n",
    "which is obvious and everybody should do as part of the dialectics of\n",
    "science.  The fact that many scientists are not willing to share their codes or \n",
    "data is detrimental to the scientific discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, we should add a disclaimer. Even though\n",
    "we may dream of computers developing some kind of higher learning\n",
    "capabilities, at the end (even if the artificial intelligence\n",
    "community keeps touting our ears full of fancy futuristic avenues), it is we\n",
    "who end up constructing and instructing, via various algorithms, the\n",
    "computers. Self-driving cars for example, rely on sofisticated\n",
    "programs which take into account all possible situations a car can\n",
    "encounter. In addition, extensive usage of training datas from GPS\n",
    "information, maps etc, are typically fed into the software for\n",
    "self-driving cars. Adding to this various sensors and cameras that\n",
    "feed information to the programs, there are zillions of ethical issues\n",
    "which arise from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For self-driving cars, where basically many of the standard machine\n",
    "learning algorithms discussed here enter into the codes, at a certain\n",
    "stage we have to make choices. Yes, we , the lads and lasses who wrote\n",
    "a program for a specific brand of a self-driving car.  As an example,\n",
    "a most carmakers have as their utmost priority the security of the\n",
    "driver and the accompanying passengers. A famous carmaker, which is\n",
    "one of the leaders in the market of self-driving cars, had **if**\n",
    "statements of the following type: suppose there are two obstacles in\n",
    "front of you and you cannot avoid to collide with one of them. One of\n",
    "the obstacles is a monstertruck while the other one is a kindergarten\n",
    "class trying to cross the road. The self-driving car algo would then\n",
    "opt for the hitting the small folks instead of the monstertruck, since\n",
    "the likelihood of surving a collision with our future citizens, is\n",
    "much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us leads then to serious ethical aspects. Why should we\n",
    "opt for such an option? Who decides and who is entitled to make such\n",
    "choices? Keep in mind that many of the algorithms you will about in\n",
    "this series of lectures or hear about later, are indeed based on\n",
    "simple programming instructions. And you are very likely to be one of\n",
    "the people who may end up writing such a code. Thus, developing a\n",
    "sound ethical attitude to what we do, an approach well beyond the\n",
    "simple mechanistic one of making our science available and\n",
    "reproducible, is much needed. The example of the self-driving cars is\n",
    "just one of infinitely many cases where we have to make choices. When\n",
    "you analyze data on economic inequalities, who guarantees that you are\n",
    "not weighting some data in a particular way, perhaps because you dearly want a\n",
    "specific conclusion which may support your political views?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have the answers here, but we want you think over these\n",
    "topics in a more overarching way.  A statistical data analysis with\n",
    "its dry numbers and graphs meant to guide the eye, do not necessarily\n",
    "reflect the truth, whatever that is.  As a scientist, and after a\n",
    "university education, you are supposedly a better citizen, with an\n",
    "improved critical view and understanding of the scientific method, and\n",
    "perhaps some deeper understandings of the ethics of science at\n",
    "large. Use these insights. Be a critical citizen. You owe it to our\n",
    "societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Our emphasis throughout this series of lectures  \n",
    "is on understanding the mathematical aspects of\n",
    "different algorithms used in the fields of data analysis and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, where possible we will emphasize the\n",
    "importance of using available software. We start thus with a hands-on\n",
    "and top-down approach to machine learning. The aim is thus to start with\n",
    "relevant data or data we have produced \n",
    "and use these to introduce statistical data analysis\n",
    "concepts and machine learning algorithms before we delve into the\n",
    "algorithms themselves. The examples we will use in the beginning, start with simple\n",
    "polynomials with random noise added. We will use the Python\n",
    "software package [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and\n",
    "introduce various machine learning algorithms to make fits of\n",
    "the data and predictions. We move thereafter to more interesting\n",
    "cases such as the simulation of financial transactions or disease\n",
    "models. These are examples where we can easily set up the data and\n",
    "then use machine learning algorithms included in for example\n",
    "**scikit-learn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These examples will serve us the purpose of getting\n",
    "started. Furthermore, they allow us to catch more than two birds with\n",
    "a stone. They will allow us to bring in some programming specific\n",
    "topics and tools as well as showing the power of various Python (and\n",
    "R) packages for machine learning and statistical data analysis. In the\n",
    "lectures on linear algebra we cover in more detail various programming\n",
    "features of languages like Python and C++ (and other), we will also\n",
    "look into more specific linear functions which are relevant for the\n",
    "various algorithms we will discuss. Here, we will mainly focus on two\n",
    "specific Python packages for Machine Learning, scikit-learn and\n",
    "tensorflow (see below for links etc).  Moreover, the examples we\n",
    "introduce will serve as inputs to many of our discussions later, as\n",
    "well as allowing you to set up models and produce your own data and\n",
    "get started with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software and needed installations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its\n",
    "myriad of available libraries.  You will find\n",
    "IPython/Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run **R**\n",
    "codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of\n",
    "visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,\n",
    "Rust, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be\n",
    "on Python, but we will provide many code examples for those of you who\n",
    "prefer R or compiled languages. You can integrate C++ codes and R in for example\n",
    "a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Python installed (we recommend Python3) and you feel\n",
    "pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that\n",
    "you install the following Python packages via **pip** as \n",
    "\n",
    "1. pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python3, replace **pip** with **pip3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to\n",
    "install **brew**. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional\n",
    "software via for example \n",
    "\n",
    "1. brew install python3\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,\n",

    "software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages\n",
    "developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK.  We describe them shortly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website <http://www.netlib.org> it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from <http://www.netlib.org>.\n",

    "The gradient descent method \n",
    "is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\\gamma_k$. This is due\n",
    "to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \\leq\n",
    "F(\\mathbf{x}_k)$ for sufficiently small $\\gamma_k$. The problem is to\n",
    "determine an optimal learning rate. If the learning rate is chosen too\n",
    "small the method will take a long time to converge and if it is too\n",
    "large we can experience erratic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by introducing\n",
    "randomness. One such method is that of Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "(SGD), see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we want our cost/loss function to be convex(concave).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we give the definition of a convex set: A set $C$ in\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be convex if, for all $x$ and $y$ in $C$ and\n",
    "all $t \\in (0,1)$ , the point $(1 − t)x + ty$ also belongs to\n",
    "C. Geometrically this means that every point on the line segment\n",
    "connecting $x$ and $y$ is in $C$ as discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convex subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals of\n",
    "$\\mathbb{R}$. Examples of convex sets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are the\n",
    "regular polygons (triangles, rectangles, pentagons, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convex function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convex function**: Let $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex set. Assume that the function $f: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is said to be convex if $$f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \\leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) $$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ and for all $t \\in [0,1]$. If $\\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \\neq x_2$ and $t\\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions on convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we state first and second-order conditions which\n",
    "ensures convexity of a function $f$. We write $D_f$ to denote the\n",
    "domain of $f$, i.e the subset of $R^n$ where $f$ is defined. For more\n",
    "details and proofs we refer to: [S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Convex Optimization. Cambridge University Press](http://stanford.edu/boyd/cvxbook/, 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    " First order condition\n",
    "Suppose $f$ is differentiable (i.e $\\nabla f(x)$ is well defined for\n",
    "all $x$ in the domain of $f$). Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$\n",
    "is a convex set and $$f(y) \\geq f(x) + \\nabla f(x)^T (y-x) $$ holds\n",
    "for all $x,y \\in D_f$. This condition means that for a convex function\n",
    "the first order Taylor expansion (right hand side above) at any point\n",
    "a global under estimator of the function. To convince yourself you can\n",
    "make a drawing of $f(x) = x^2+1$ and draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ and\n",
    "note that it is always below the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Second order condition \n",
    "Assume that $f$ is twice\n",
    "differentiable, i.e the Hessian matrix exists at each point in\n",
    "$D_f$. Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$ is a convex set and its\n",
    "Hessian is positive semi-definite for all $x\\in D_f$. For a\n",
    "single-variable function this reduces to $f''(x) \\geq 0$. Geometrically this means that $f$ has nonnegative curvature\n",
    "everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is particularly useful since it gives us an procedure for determining if the function under consideration is convex, apart from using the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The next result is of great importance to us and the reason why we are\n",
    "going on about convex functions. In machine learning we frequently\n",
    "have to minimize a loss/cost function in order to find the best\n",
    "parameters for the model we are considering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we want the\n",
    "global minimum (for high-dimensional models it is hard to know\n",
    "if we have local or global minimum). However, if the cost/loss function\n",
    "is convex the following result provides invaluable information:\n",
    "\n",
    " Any minimum is global for convex functions\n",
    "Consider the problem of finding $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(x)$\n",
    "is minimal, where $f$ is convex and differentiable. Then, any point\n",
    "$x^*$ that satisfies $\\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ is a global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This result means that if we know that the cost/loss function is convex and we are able to find a minimum, we are guaranteed that it is a global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some simple problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ using the definition of convexity. Hint: If you re-write the definition, $f$ is convex if the following holds for all $x,y \\in D_f$ and any $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ $\\lambda f(x)+(1-\\lambda)f(y)-f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda) y ) \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the second order condition show that the following functions are convex on the specified domain.\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(x) = e^x$ is convex for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " * $g(x) = -\\ln(x)$ is convex for $x \\in (0,\\infty)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = e^x$. Show that $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is convex for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Also show that if $f(x)$ is any convex function than $h(x) = e^{f(x)}$ is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A norm is any function that satisfy the following properties\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(\\alpha x) = |\\alpha| f(x)$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(x+y) \\leq f(x) + f(y)$\n",
    "\n",
    " * $f(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ with equality if and only if $x = 0$\n",

    "* **Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function**. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our energy function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is sensitive to initial conditions**. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets**. In many cases in statistics and ML, the energy function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called \"mini batches\". This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates**. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly.** Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.\n",

    "## Practical tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Randomize the data when making mini-batches**. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transform your inputs**. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the energy matrix is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Monitor the out-of-sample performance.** Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization.** Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.\n",

    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",

    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",

    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",
    "neuron interact with other neurons by sending signals in the form of\n",
    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",

    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",

    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumnavigate these problems.\n",
