# FYS-STK3155/4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning, http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html


This site contains all material relevant for the course on Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning FYS-STK3155/4155 at the University of Oslo, Norway.

## Introduction

Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one
hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to years of content every
day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion  base pairs, have
been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis,
which is exactly what machine learning aims at providing. 

## Learning outcomes

This course aims at giving you insights and knowledge about  many of the central algorithms used in Data Analysis and Machine Learning.  The course is project based and through  various numerical projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. Both supervised and unsupervised methods will be covered. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying different cases where Machine Learning is applied to, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

- Learn about basic data analysis, statistical analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo sampling, data optimization and machine learning;
- Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
- Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
- Understand linear methods for regression and classification, from ordinary least squares, via Lasso and Ridge to Logistic regression;
- Learn about neural networks and deep  learning methods for supervised and unsupervised learning. Emphasis on feed forward neural networks and convolutional neural networks; 
- Learn about about decision trees, random forests, bagging and boosting methods;
- Learn about support vector machines and kernel transformations;
- Reduction of data sets, from PCA to clustering;
- Autoencoders and Reinforcement Learning;
- Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.  

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge in programming and mathematics, with an emphasis on linear algebra. Knowledge of Python or/and C++ as programming languages is strongly recommended and experience with Jupiter notebook is recommended. Required courses are the equivalents to the University of Oslo mathematics courses MAT1100, MAT1110, MAT1120 and at least one of the corresponding computing and programming courses INF1000/INF1110 or MAT-INF1100/MAT-INF1100L/BIOS1100/KJM-INF1100. Most universities offer nowadays a basic programming course (often compulsory) where Python is the recurring programming language.


## The course has two central parts

1. Statistical analysis and optimization of data
2. Machine learning

These topics will be scattered thorughout the course and may not  necessarily be taught separately. Rather, we will often take an approach (during the lectures and project/exercise sessions) where say elements from statistical data analysis are mixed with specific Machine Learning algorithms. 

### Statistical analysis and optimization of data

The following topics will be covered
- Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
- Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
- Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
- Gradient methods for data optimization
- Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm;
- Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
- Principal Component Analysis and its mathematical foundation

### Machine learning

The following topics will be covered
- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression;
- Neural networks and deep learning, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks
- Decisions trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting
- Support vector machines
- Bayesian linear and logistic regression
- Boltzmann Machines
- Unsupervised learning Dimensionality reduction, from PCA to cluster models

Hands-on demonstrations, exercises and projects aim at deepening your understanding of these topics.

Computational aspects play a central role and you are
expected to work on numerical examples and projects which illustrate
the theory and varous algorithms discussed during the lectures. We recommend strongly to form small project groups of 2-3 participants.

9. We use Piazza for course communication, a special link on how to register to Piazza can be found at the official University of Oslo page for the course. Slack is also used for course communication. The Slack link is machinelearninguio.slack.com ;

## Required Technologies: 
Specify any additional materials, including software, and hardware, and Internet connection, that students must purchase (or have access to) for the course. State if any hardware or software is required for assessment (e.g. a webcam). In selecting/preparing materials abide by the MSU Accessibility Policies.
•	If you use any special technology e.g. clickers, Tophat etc, please add instructions here. ***If there is a cost, this must be indicated in the Schedule of Courses.***
•	Consider including pointers for which browsers and internet speeds are best for working with D2L:
o	Browser/mobile support for D2L:https://documentation.brightspace.com/EN/brightspace/requirements/all/browser_support.htm
•	Consider including a guide for internet speed:  https://broadbandnow.com/guides/how-much-internet-speed-do-i-need. For most courses, 25 Mbps should work. If there is no mandatory video component, then students may be able to interact with the course with a slower connection. Most courses have a generic statement that says the course requires access to "high speed" internet. 
•	Consider including information about how students can access internet connections, including those companies offering students free or reduced cost internet: https://remote.msu.edu/learning/internet.html
•	Remember that not all students have access to reliable internet. Specify your expectations if students encounter difficulties--including outages--during synchronous sessions, exams, etc.

## Personal Hygiene:
Washing hands Personal Hygiene. All students must maintain proper hygiene and health practices, including:
•	frequently with soap and water or, if soap is unavailable, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol
•	Routinely cleaning and sanitizing living spaces and/or workspace
•	Using the bend of the elbow or shoulder to shield a cough or sneeze
•	Refraining from shaking hands

Adherence to Signage and Instructions. Students will (a) look for instructional signs posted by MSU or public health authorities, (b) observe instructions from MSU or public health authorities that are emailed to my “msu.edu” account, and (c) follow those instructions.
Self-Monitoring. Students will self-monitor for flu-like symptoms (for example, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of taste or smell). If a student experiences any flu-like symptoms, they will stay home and contact a health care provider to determine what steps should be taken.
Exposure to COVID-19. If a student is exposed to someone who is ill or has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, they will stay home, contact a health care provider and follow all public health recommendations.
Compliance and reporting. Those who come to MSU facilities must commit to the personal responsibility necessary for us to remain as safe as possible, including following the specific guidelines outlined in this syllabus and provided by MSU more broadly (see below). There may be times when action will be necessary to reinforce expectations. If you do not wear appropriate face coverings (see MSU’s guidelines), do not wear your face covering appropriately (i.e., over your mouth and nose), or do not adhere to physical distancing guidelines (i.e., six feet apart), you will be asked to correct the situation or leave the facility. In addition, MSU will utilize the processes already in place to respond to any issues of noncompliance with standards established for the health and safety of our community. For classroom disruptions or issues, the responses and processes that have been used previously remain the first line of action. If necessary, the student conduct system will be the avenue used to adjudicate student disciplinary situations.
